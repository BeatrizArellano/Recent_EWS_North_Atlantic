# Recent and early twentieth century destabilization of the subpolar North Atlantic recorded in bivalves

This repository contains the Python code used in the study "Recent and early twentieth century destabilization of the subpolar North Atlantic recorded in bivalves"

The analyses can be found in these Notebooks:

  - [Multidecadal variability of AR(1) and lambda](Multidecadal_variability_AR1_lambda.ipynb)
  - [Robustness and significance of trends before 1920](1920s_episode.ipynb)
  - [Robustness and significance of trends over recent decades](Recent_episode.ipynb)
  - [Spatial correlations with EN4 temperatures](Spatial_correlations.ipynb)
  - [Correlations with SPG temperatures and other indices](Corrs_SPG_temp.ipynb)


The Python module (`ews`) used to assess changes in resilience, significance and robustness can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/BeatrizArellano/regimeshifts) or within the [lib](lib/ews.py) folder in this repository.
